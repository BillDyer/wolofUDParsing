Improving UD parser for Wolof using edited Wolof treebanks

Each of these sets of development, training, and test files is an edited treebank. Parsers were trained for each model and compared to the baseline for the Wolof UD treebank (Dione, 2019), as presented in "New syntactic insights for automated Wolof Universal Dependency parsing."
